Ruby_Practice_Beginner
======================

Where I keep ruby programs I make as a way to hone my skills.
Each and every file in this repository is a different program that I used to learn the language.
This repository is simply junk to anyone else, and will not serve anyone aside from myself.
This is also a way for me to learn how to use github.
